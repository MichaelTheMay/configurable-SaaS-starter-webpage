# Custom Pages Guide

Learn how to create unlimited custom pages without writing any code!

## üìÑ Overview

The template includes a dynamic page system where you can define pages entirely in `config.ts`. Each page is automatically:
- Routed (e.g., `/about` loads your About page)
- Styled with your theme
- Given navigation and footer
- Made responsive
- SEO optimized

## üéØ Page Structure

Every page needs these properties:

```typescript
{
  path: "/your-path",          // URL (e.g., "/about", "/pricing")
  title: "Page Title",          // Browser tab title
  inMenu: true,                 // Show in navigation bar?
  content: {                    // Page content definition
    hero: {
      title: "Hero Title",
      subtitle: "Hero Subtitle"
    },
    sections: [/* ... */]       // Content sections
  }
}
```

## üìë Section Types

### 1. Text Section
Display formatted text content

```typescript
{
  type: "text",
  title: "Section Title",
  content: "Your content here. Can include multiple paragraphs separated by \n newlines."
}
```

**Best For:**
- About us content
- Company history
- Mission statements
- Product descriptions
- Legal text (privacy, terms)

**Example:**
```typescript
{
  type: "text",
  title: "Our Mission",
  content: "We help businesses succeed with powerful tools.\nFounded in 2024, we've served over 1000 customers."
}
```

### 2. Team Section
Display team member profiles

```typescript
{
  type: "team",
  title: "Meet Our Team",
  members: [
    {
      name: "John Doe",
      role: "CEO & Founder",
      bio: "10 years leading tech companies",
      image: "/static/team/john.jpg",
      social: {
        linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe",
        twitter: "https://twitter.com/johndoe"
      }
    },
    // Add more members...
  ]
}
```

**Best For:**
- Team/About pages
- Leadership pages
- Advisory boards
- Staff directories

**Tips:**
- Add team photos to `public/static/team/`
- If no image exists, shows auto-generated avatar
- Social links are optional
- LinkedIn/Twitter supported

### 3. Blog List (Coming Soon)
Placeholder for blog functionality

```typescript
{
  type: "blog_list"
  // No configuration needed
}
```

Shows "Blog Coming Soon" message. You can implement actual blog functionality later.

### 4. Contact Form
Uses your lead form configuration

```typescript
{
  type: "contact_form"
  // Uses leadForm config from main config
}
```

Automatically creates a contact page with your lead generation form.
